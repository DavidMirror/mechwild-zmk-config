# This file determines which shields will be built for which boards.
# By default, only the settings_reset firmware will be built for boards that have been tested with MechWild shields.
# Remove the boards and/or shields you don't need, and add the ones you do need.

# ADVANCED:
# You can use the `cmake-args` property to pass flags to the build command, and `artifact-name` to assign a name to
# distinguish build outputs from each other:
#  - board: nice_nano_v2
#    shield: corne_left
#    cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_USB_LOGGING=y
#    artifact-name: corne_left_with_logging

include:
  - board: nice_nano
    shield: settings_reset
#  - board: nice_nano_v2
